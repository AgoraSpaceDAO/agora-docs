**Social oracle and token utility toolkit**

A framework for all social token tools and the first use-case for social oracle networks. Social media meets blockchain in the form of a two-way integration system.  
We are building an integration layer for existing solutions, a platform to allow tokenized communities to flourish with our broad service pack. Agora Space elevates tokenized communities, helping their founders and members alike. Anyone with a tokenized community has the opportunity to give their group rich utility and they can achieve this even without any coding skills and with minimal effort.

Agora Space is a platform where users can do everything that is related to social token communities.

## Who is it for?

Those who want to make their community more efficient and rewarding.

Although, first and foremost DAO frameworks and crypto-related community founders. However, Agora Space‚Äôs tools individually are useful for creatives and influencers as well.

Those who are looking for a new decentralized ecosystem and are not afraid of using tokens to improve their experience.

## What is the vision for the rest of 2021 and more?

We are continuing development with the integration of the Agora Social Oracle layer.

Our already existing social token explorer will become ‚Äúthe App Store‚Äù to find tokenized communities. The vision is that we are getting more and more protocols involved while improving the governance processes on DAO frameworks with the Agora Social Oracle layer.

This year we are also going to focus on growing our service package with:

* Integrating other token issuers
* Token admin dashboard
* Bridging a token between blockchains with full utility 

As the platform develops and the toolkit becomes easier to use we are going to get less tech-savvy users on board as well.

**Other Plans include:**

* Integrating diverse projects for their own special use. **Superfluid** for our performance-based creator contracts and automating payments based on events outside the blockchain with the Agora Social Oracle. **EAS** for proof of ownership, using it in our reputation and gamification-based tools and for KYCs. **Roll** so we can make it even easier to issue social tokens. **Colony.io** for users who would like to create new DAOs. **NFT platforms** for the Agora Social Oracle layer to be able to create trustless and dynamic NFTs
* Creating an open-source toolkit from our tools to serve the developer community to allow faster growth of the space.
* Providing market-making and a decentralized marketplace for community tokens

We are building a space where each founder can establish their own ‚ÄòAgora‚Äô for their communities and furnish it with Agora‚Äôs tools and collectibles.

## What is our 'triforce', our strength?

üëâ Our tireless syndicate is working on establishing partnerships and integrations with existing protocols and strategic investors.

üëâ We keep on expanding the swiss-knife for tokenized communities. We make sure to cater to all the needs of community founders and managers by providing a platform for marketing, analytics, tokenomics, token utilities, and market-making as well.

üëâ $AGORA DAO: Members contribute to and boost their community‚Äôs treasury by staking $AGORA tokens. With this, we put an emphasis on the real 'community' feel of the whole space. Read more about the $AGORA token usage here:
