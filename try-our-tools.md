# Try Our Tools

By following these steps you can be one of the first ones to gain access to the demo version of the Agora Space Community and our role-management bot Medusa. 

## 1. Prerequisites for QuickSwap

First of all, you need to purchase MATIC tokens, and then deposit them into your web wallet, like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet or any compatible wallet with the QuickSwap exchange. Don't worry, for the highest privileges, you only need to **Stake 500 AGOTEST** tokens, which costs around **0.05 MATIC.**

{% hint style="info" %}
 QuickSwap â€” a decentralized finance product. It's a fork of the popular Uniswap decentralized exchange \(DEX\), except it runs on the Polygon network \(formerly Matic Network\). Running on a Layer 2 scaling solution like Polygon enables it to achieve low fees and complete trades in a matter of seconds \(even if Ethereum is congested\). Polygon runs atop the Ethereum network.
{% endhint %}

In this walkthrough, we will use _MetaMask_. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are not familiar with MetaMask or wallet creation, you can follow the guide below.  
[https://myterablock.medium.com/how-to-create-or-import-a-metamask-wallet-a551fc2f5a6b](https://myterablock.medium.com/how-to-create-or-import-a-metamask-wallet-a551fc2f5a6b)
{% endhint %}

## 2. Add Matic Network To Metamask

If you have **already** added **Matic Network** to your MetaMask wallet, you could skip this section as well.

Open MetaMask, then click the _circular image in the top right corner_ of your Metamask window. Select _Settings / Networks / Add Network_.

![Add Matic Mainnet to your MetaMask](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

> Network Name: Matic Mainnet  
> New RPC URL: [https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/](https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/)  
> ChainID: 137  
> Symbol: MATIC  
> Block Explorer URL: [https://explorer.matic.network/](https://explorer.matic.network/)

After completing the instructions above, scroll down and click _Save_. Usually, MetaMask switches to the newly added Network, but if that doesn't happen, just switch it manually to the Matic Mainnet at the top of your wallet.  
  
Let's exchange a few AGOTEST tokens on QuickSwap in the section below.

## 3. Connect your wallet to QuickSwap

Go to [https://quickswap.exchange/](https://quickswap.exchange/) and connect your MetaMask wallet in the top right corner.

## 4. Import AGOTEST Tokens

Click _Select a token_, then paste our **AGOTEST** \(0xfF9bAaC24c68d810af1F98012d3D25B0Ea83902e\) token address into the field, you can click on the _Add_ button, and next time you do not have to copy at all_._

## 6. Get in Touch
