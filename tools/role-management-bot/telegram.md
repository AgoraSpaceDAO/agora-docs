# Telegram bot

## 1. Convert to Supergroup

Make sure, your Telegram Group is a Supergroup, because Medusa and any other bot is only able to invite users in Supergroups.

Upgrading your Group into Supergroup is a bit tricky, but we will try to explain it in a simple way.

Click on your _Group name_, open the chat and find the three-dotted button in the top right corner of your screen, then select _Manage Group_.

Select Group type:

Change your group type to Public Group, then save it:

![Choose Public Group](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

Repeat the steps above \(Manage Group - Select Group type\), then select Private Group to convert back your Group:

After these steps, your group will surely be converted into a Supergroup. You can check it in [Telegram's browser client](https://web.telegram.org/). You should see something like this:

## 2. Invite Medusa

In your group, find _Add Members_ button:

![Select Add Members](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2828%29.png)

Type **@agoraspacebot** into the text search field, then click on Medusa and Add her to your group:

![Select Medusa](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2820%29.png)

![Add Medusa](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2822%29.png)

## 3. Promote Medusa to Admin

After you successfully added our Bot to your Telegram Group, give her Administrator privileges.  
Find her in the Members Tab, then right-click on her name, then choose the Promote to admin button:

Good job, Medusa is now guarding your Telegram Groups as well. Don't forget to invite her into every Telegram Group, which you would like to manage with our tool.
