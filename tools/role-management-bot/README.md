# Role-management bot

**A role management bot:** This ****is the first tool we developed for Agora Space.  
Our bot Hermes \(under maintenance\) bridges Telegram and Discord channels and his ally Medusa guards your token gated communities. You can invite the bots to your channels with the press of a button and Medusa will manage all affairs of admitting and dismissing people from your groups based on how much they hold or stake of your token.

The toolkit keeps expanding as we are establishing more and more strategic partnerships and integrate more useful protocols.   
We are also very attentive with our development to the needs of our community, the syndicate and the founders who are already using Agora Space.
