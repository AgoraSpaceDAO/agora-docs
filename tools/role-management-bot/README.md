# Token-gated access

**A role management bot:** This is the first tool we developed for Agora Space.  
Medusa guards your token gated communities. You can invite the bot to your channels with the press of a button and Medusa will manage all affairs of admitting and dismissing people from your groups based on how much they hold or stake of your token.  
This tool also serves as a gateway to access all the other tools on Agora Space.

Our bot Hermes \(under maintenance\) bridges Telegram and Discord channels.

This tool also serves as a gateway to access all the other tools on Agora Space. 

The toolkit keeps expanding as we are establishing more and more strategic partnerships and integrate more useful protocols.  
We are also very attentive with our development to the needs of our community, the syndicate, and the founders who are already using Agora Space.
